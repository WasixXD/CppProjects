<h1 > Graphing Quadratic Functions </h1>
<p >
 a program I wrote to help me with my homework,
it uses the pbPlot.cpp library, so https://github.com/InductiveComputerScience/pbPlots give them a star!

## How to compile
open your terminal and write:
```console
g++ main.cpp pbPlot.cpp supportLib.cpp -o main
```
and after:
```
./main
```

after running the program, open the files folder and open plot.png and you will see the graph
